# Attendance-Management-Software-for-Children-For-Christ
Our project is impact-driven and focused on assisting the management of Children for Christ to keep track of the children they work with daily which are mostly children from the Chokor community in the Greater Accra region. In details, the system is to help them document the children and record necessary information for future use. This is to enable teachers who are volunteers to learn more about the students and for students to have the feeling of belonging to the home. The main aim of this project is to capture the necessary information of these children mainly through interviewing. At the end of the exercise, an application that records the basic information of children and tracks attendance to meeting and activities held within the home would be deployed.
